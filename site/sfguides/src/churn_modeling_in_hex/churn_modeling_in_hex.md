# Churn modeling


## Lab Overview 
In this demo, we will play the role of a data scientist at a telecom company that wants to identify users who are at high risk of churning. To accomplish this, we need to build a model that can learn how to identify such users. We will demonstrate how to use Hex in conjunction with Snowflake/Snowpark to build a Random Forest Classifier to help us with this task.

### Prerequisites
* Familiarity with basic Python and SQL
* Familiarity with training ML models
* Familiarity with data science notebooks



### What You'll Learn
* How to import/export data between Hex and Snowflake
* How to train a Random Forest model and deploy to Snowflake using UDFs
* How to visualize the predicted results from the forecasting model
* How to convert a Hex project into an interactive web app and make predictions on new users
